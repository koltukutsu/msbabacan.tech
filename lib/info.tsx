      When I'm not typing code with glee,<br></br>
      I read books, learn tongues, and research thee,<br></br>
      I love to chat with friends and ponder,<br></br>
      And come up with ideas like a true wonder.<br></br>

      With knowledge, I constantly feed,<br></br>

      It keeps me sharp and never archaic!<br></br>
